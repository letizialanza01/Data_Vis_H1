    "- create a small multiple chart with histograms of track popularity for the different genres. Choose an optimal binning\n",
    "- compare the distributions of the average song duration for the different genres using a visualization idiom for statistical analysis\n",
    "- create a chart showing the how much the attributes (popularity, danceability, energy, loudness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo) are correlated. Use a proper colormap\n",
    "- visualize a scatter plot with songs released in 2010, representing loudness and danceability on the x-y coordinates, dots colored by genres and using a different mark (pre-attentive) to make a specific artist of your interest evident"
